      "Luna is a general-purpose programming language with an intuitive visual interface that is dedicated to data science applications. In this presentation we will show how to improve interpretation of results and communication, including with non-technical business experts, by making data visualization the driving component of data science workflow.\n",
      "Recently neural networks have become superior in many machine learning tasks. However, they are more difficult to interpret than simpler models such as decision trees. Such a condition is not acceptable in industries like healthcare or law. In this talk, I will talk on unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model, especially neural networks.\n",
      "The data we need is sourced from different places. The data could even come in different formats. I will talk about how I used data from different APIs, cleaned and preprocessed it, and wrapped it up under a new API for a restaurant discovery service. This talk is for attendees looking to jump into the data science industry for the first time.\n",
      "Imbalance ratio is a definition describing relation of frequency of data classified to following classification classes.

I will also touch on the topic of analogies between creative processes and machine learning processes.\n",
      "In Natural Language Processing, where we want to use a supervised model the frequent problem is the availability of labels. One way of circumventing tedious and cost-intensive manual annotation of (tens) of thousands of samples may be weak supervision, where heuristics, fragmentary datasets with annotations and crowd-sourced indications (on a fraction of samples) can be unified to generate labels.\n",
      "K3D-jupyter is a notebook visualization package which we have been developing since 2015.

      "numpy and numba are popular Python libraries for processing large quantities of data. This talk explains how numpy/numba work under the hood and how they use vectorisation to process large amounts of data extremely quickly. We use these tools to reduce the processing time of a large, real 600GB dataset from one month to 40 minutes, even when the code is run on a single Macbook Pro.\n",
      "Ads on the web often consist of a picture with some text. Based on this information, can you tell what exactly is advertised?

      "Much of our daily life is quietly being reshaped by AI, with 47 million people already using Alexa in their homes in USA only and an entire generation of children growing up with this technology. I believe the best way to understand how AI works is by doing.\n",
      "Over the past several years, two trends in machine learning have converged to pique the curiosity of artists working with code: the proliferation of powerful open source deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Torch, and the emergence of data-intensive generative models for hallucinating images, sounds, and text as though they came from the oeuvre of Shakespeare, Picasso, or just a gigantic database of digitized cats.\n",
      "It is commonly accepted that about 80% of data scientists time is spent on preparing data, including setting up the proper data pipeline or ETL. For a large part, the proper configuration of a given data pipeline is the result of the data scientist experience and Subject Matter Expert knowledge, plus a dose of arbitrary decisions. What if most of this work could be automated? Better, is it possible to find some universal pipeline configurations that can work well on a wide range of domains and thus transfer what has been learn on one dataset to another?\n",
      "Deep neural network give very good results in visual object recognition tasks, but they require large number of training examples from each category. I'll present a class of neural network architectures, that can be used when only few training examples from each class are available. They are based on 'similarity learning' concept and can be used to solve various practical problems.\n",
      "The presentation shows the application of Recurrent Neural Network to the problem of innovative drug design. The audience will also have an opportunity to get familiar with modern cheminformtics libraries available in Python ecosystem. The final element of the preeentation is live demonstration of the pretrained, generative predictove model applied to generation of new molecules.\n",
      "I will present a high-level overview of how automated image analysis approaches can be incorporated into pharmaceutical discovery pipelines.

I will highlight how these techniques benefit the drug discovery process.\n",
      "We will share our experience gained during development of ‘learning to rank’ system in an e-commerce setting.

According to WHO data, 15 million children are born prematurely every year, of which 1.1 million dies, unfortunately. In this talk, we will present how to improve prediction rate of the spontaneous preterm delivery using deep learning and computer vision methods.\n",
      "The talk will introduce a problem of upscaling a picture with as small loss of quality as possible using deep learning techniques. What metric to use when evaluating the solution? Upsample the image in the beginning or near the end of your neural network? Which upscaling layers to use? Answers to these and more questions on this topic will be discussed.\n",
      "At our company we like to eat burgers. Also, we like to analyse data. So on one Friday we decided to leverage our expertise and use online reviews, ratings and images to find us the best hamburger nearby our office in Amsterdam. This talk will be about that quest, and about the (overkill of) tools that we used for this purpose: Scrapy, ElasticSearch, Google's Vision API and BigQuery.\n",
      "Finally a good real-life use case for Reinforcement Learning (RL): traffic control! In this talk I will show you how we hooked up traffic simulation software to Python and how we built our own custom `gym` environment to run RL experiments with `keras-rl` for a simple 4-way intersection.\n",

      "Identifying the number of hidden units in a fully connected layer is considered a heuristically-guided craft. A PyTorch library, Delve, was developed that allows identifying the degree of over-parameterization of a layer, thus guiding architecture selection. The library compares the intrinsic dimensionality of the layer over training, providing the user with live feedback during training.\n"
